Project Proposal: Binary Classification of Serengeti Zebras and Elephants Using Image Processing 
Problem Description 
Accurate classification of wildlife species from camera trap images is essential for ecological 
monitoring and conservation efforts. This project aims to develop a binary image classification model 
to distinguish between zebras (Equus quagga) and elephants (Loxodonta africana) in the Serengeti. 
Both species are keystone herbivores that shape the landscape, making their identification critical for 
studying species distribution patterns and ecological interactions. 
By automating the identification process, this model will reduce manual effort in camera trap image 
analysis and enhance the efficiency of biodiversity monitoring programs. 
Input-Output Statement 
• Input: Camera trap image of a zebra or elephant in .jpg format. 
• Output: 
o Classification label: 
▪ 0: Zebra 
▪ 1: Elephant 
Data Source 
The project will use the "Snapshot Serengeti" dataset available on Kaggle.

For this project, the image classification will be performed using the VGG11 architecture.
